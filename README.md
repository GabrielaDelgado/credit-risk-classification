Credit Rish Classification Challenge

Contributor: Gabriela Delgado

Overview

This project uses basic concepts of machine learning to create training sets used for logistic regression models. In this assignment, I created a logisted regression modeled, resampled the data and compared the results of a second logistic regression model using the resampled training sets to the original model. It showed that the resampled data obtained better results based on the accuracy and confusion matrix. Therefore, it can be assumed that it is a better model.

This Challenge contains a ReadMe file, csv files with the datasets, and a Jupyter notebook file with the code.

Git Bash

I used GitBash to download the repository to my desktop and push and commit the changes made to the code into the repository.
